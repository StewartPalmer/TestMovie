                            Paula has been an actor, director and producer for over 40 years, in both live theater as well as film. Since moving to NYC
                            six years ago, she has continued following her passion for both new play development and improvisation
                            – performing for Samuel French OOB Short Play Festival and onstage at Upright Citizens Brigade.
                            Paula has also worked on film sets in various production capacities, and been seen in several
                            television shows, over a dozen short films, five new web series, and roles in two independent
                            films (Landing Up and Women and Sometimes Men,) slated for release later this year. Under her
                            LLC, Wall is the Way: Works, Paula has involved in producing and directing several short films
                            making the rounds on the film festival circuit: a satirical comedy, The Other Side, a horror/psychological
                            thriller, Evil Rising, and the soon-to-be-released issue-driven drama, The Red Lotus. Along with
                            a relationship drama, The Light Watcher, which just finished shooting in Martha’s Vineyard and
                            is currently in post-production, Paula is involved in two other short films in various stages
                            of pre-production. Working with her friend, Brock Yurick, on his feature, Test, is her debut
                            as a producer on a feature.
